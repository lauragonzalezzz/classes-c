    CONSOLE APPLICATION : Classes-C Project Overview
========================================================================

In this project I created classes for Node and ListOfInt to demonstrate how
a data structure could be abstracted from the developer but still provide
some easy to use methods, as well as practice my skills in using C/C++.
I used a linked list behind the scenes and exposed the following methods:

Add
Remove
Clear
GetAtPosition
GetLength
Sort
